\section{In situ datasets\label{sec:insitu}}
Two main types of data are considered: the profiles and the time series. They are processed separately but then used together for the production of the climatologies. Six variables (concentrations) were considered for the gridded products (Sec.~ref{}): ammonium, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate and silicate.



\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Data locations corresponding for the phosphate concentration measurements.\label{fig:phosphatedata}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Domains}
The 6 regional domains are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:phosphatedata} and were defined as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Black Sea:] from 26.5°E to 41.95°E and from 40°N to 48°N;
\item[Mediterranean Sea:] from 6°W to 36.375°E and from 30°N to 46.375°N;
\item[Baltic Sea:] from 9.4°E to 30.9°E and from 53°N, to 66°N
\item[North Sea:] from 5.4°W to 13°E and from 48°N to 62°N;
\item[Arctic Sea:] from 42°W to 80°E and from 62°N to 83°N;
\item[North-East Atlantic Ocean:] from 42°W to 0° and from 24°N to 48°N.
\end{description}

		
The domains have been prepared so that there is no overlay between them, in particular: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean have their limit at the longitude of the Strait of Gibraltar;
\item The Sea of Marmara is assigned to the Mediterranean Sea region;
\item The North Sea and the NE Atlantic Ocean are separated by an imaginary line at 48°N, corresponding approximately to the latitude of Brittany (western France);
\item The Baltic Sea and the North Sea have their limit located 
\end{itemize}
We can see the almost straight lines corresponding to oceanographic campaigns and also the availability of coastal data, with the exception of the northern coast of Africa. 

\subsection{Spatial distribution}

The hexbin plot (Fig. ) provides another view on the data density. The regions with the highest coverage are located in the Baltic Sea and in the southern part of the North Sean while in general lower data densities are found at the edges of the global domain. The Mediterranean sea also exhibits an inhomogeneous data coverage. 

The panels of Fig. x also highlights the differences between the variables: for phosphate, silicate and oxygen, most of the domain is covered, whereas for ammonium, dissolved organic nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, chlorophyll, large subdomains are almost void of measurements. This will impact the quality of the interpolated field (Section …), which depends on the quality of the measurements and their availability.

\subsection{Value distributions}

The value distribution (Fig. ) shows different patterns according to the variable considered. The dissolved oxygen concentration is the closest to a Gaussian. Ammonium, chlorophyll-a, nitrogen and silicate distributions are all characterised by a dominant number of measurements for small concentrations (close to zero) and few observations of high concentration. The case of phosphate seems to be a superposition of the two previous cases, where the lar







\subsection{File format}
The original data collections are provided as ODV \citep[Ocean Data View,][]{SCHLITZER02} data collections. Such collections are easily read then exported to another format using the ODV software tool. In the present work we exported the collections to netCDF files, which are in turn are used as input files for the preparation of the climatologies (next Section). 
Along with the data (coordinates, time, depth and observed values), a set of metadata is assigned to each measurement. The complete list of metadata items is provided in the Appendix. Among them we find information about the instrument, the cruise and the institute that performed the measurements. 

\section{The interpolation method}


\section{Gridded climatologies\label{sec:clim}}

The climatologies, consisting of a set of gridded fields for different depths and time periods, are produced by applying the Data Interpolating Variational Analysis in n dimensions (DIVAnd, see next Section) to the datasets presented in Section~\ref{sec:insitu}. Such gridded fields are frequently used in oceanography, for different purposes ranging from data visualisation to model initialisation or validation of measurements.  
While temperature and salinity (T and S) climatologies have been produced for various regions of the World Ocean using different interpolation techniques, climatologies for eutrophication-related variables are less frequent. The World Ocean Atlas (WOA) makes climatologies available for oxygen \citep[Dissolved Oxygen, Apparent Oxygen Utilization, and Oxygen Saturation][]{GARCIA2018a} and for dissolved inorganic nutrients \citep[phosphate, nitrate and nitrate+nitrite, silicate][]{GARCIA2018b} at a resolution of 1° by 1° for the global ocean. The availability of measurements from the EMODnet Chemistry data collections makes it  possible to increase the spatial resolution in certain domains, hence the interest of the regional products presented in this paper.

\subsection{Method}

DIVAnd is an analysis method designed to generate fields on a curvilinear grid grid from a set of in situ measurements \citep{BARTH2014}. It is a new version of the DIVA tool (REFERENCES) that was previously limited to 2 dimensions (usually longitude and latitude). With DIVAnd, it is now possible to perform the analysis on an arbitrary number of dimensions, typically the horizontal dimension (longitudes and latitudes), the vertical dimension (depth or pressure) and the time. With the previous version of  the DIVA tool, climatologies were obtained by stacking 2-dimensional layers computed for different depths and time periods. 
One of the main advantages of the method over widely used methods such as the Optimal Interpolation (OI, REFERENCE) is that DIVAnd (and DIVA) naturally takes into account physical obstacles, typically the presence of land separating two bodies of water.  
DIVAnd is written in Julia \citep[][\url{https://julialang.org/}]{Julia-2017}, a fast, dynamically-type programming language, designed to ensure high-performance computation. While the previous code was written in Fortran, Julia ensures that high-resolution analysis using several millions of data points could be run in reasonable times, i.e. maximum a few days for the largest domain. This is necessary as usually to create a regional climatology, it is necessary to repeat the analysis several times in order to adapt the parameters and correct possible issues.
