\begin{abstract}
We present high-resolution, regional climatologies of eutrophication variables covering the European seas. The variables consist of ammonium, chlorophyll-a, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, phosphate and silicate concentrations. The in situ observations are prepared and quality controlled following a standardised procedure. They are then interpolated using the Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis in n dimensions (DIVAnd) to create the climatologies. They are generated on a spatial domain covering all the Europeans seas, on 6 regional domains (Arctic Ocean, Northeast Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and North Sea) as well as 4 coastal zones (Loire River, Gulf of Riga, Po River and Danube Delta).

The spatial resolution and the analysis parameters are adapted to each domain.

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

EMODnet (European Marine Observation and Data Network) is the in situ, marine data service of the European Commission Directorate-General Maritime Affairs and Fisheries \citep{MartinMiguez2019}. According to \citet{Shepherd2018}, The key features of EMODnet are : 1. The focus on marine data: EMODnet does not deal with satellite data or fisheries survey; 2. The design and distribution of multi-purpose data products, based on the raw data; 3. the preservation of the data origin and ownership (both for the raw data and for the products); 4. The division into thematic lots: bathymetry, biology, chemistry, geology, human activities, physics and seabed habitats. 

The web portal has the objective of delivering marine data, products and metadata in a uniform and seamless way, thanks to common standards, procedures and vocabularies. Thanks to the always improving data access, a wider range of users can be reached, potentially leading to sustainable economic development, often referred to as the Blue Growth. 


One of the underlying principle of EMODnet can be summarised by the motto "\textit{Collect once, use many times}". Indeed, it is frequent that marine data are initially collected with a single purpose: this can a scientific project or a monitoring campaign. The combination of those observations with other sources of measurements or other parameters has the potential for the creation of new, added-value products that were not considered originally. Examples of such added-value products include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The aggregated datasets: they consist of large ensembles of measurements obtained from various data providers; the measurements general undergo a suite of checks to ensure that their quality is good enough (depending on the final purpose).
\item The climatologies (or atlas): they consist of various gridded fields at different depth levels and for different time periods, obtained by interpolating the in situ observations on a regular grid.
\end{enumerate}

Both types of products are accompanied with metadata, which indicate how, when and by who the data were collected. For the climatologies, metadata also have to include information about all the individual data providers who contributed to the final products. 

The rest of the manuscript is organised as follows: first we describe the in situ observations used for the creation of the gridded products, since they already constitute a useful product; then we present the gridded technique, DIVAnd, applied to the observations; finally we describe the final product (climatologies). 


\section{In situ datasets\label{sec:insitu}}
%-------------------------------------------


- Describe EMODnet Chemistry \citep{Giorgetti2018}

Two main types of data are considered: the profiles and the time series. They are processed separately but then used together for the production of the climatologies. Six variables (concentrations) were considered (Sec.~ref{}): ammonium, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate and silicate.

\subsection{Variables}

Eutrophication variables are those related to nutrients and their accumulation in the water column. In this work and for the sake of simplicity, the focus is placed on 6 of these variables, as summarised in Table~\ref{tab:variables}.

The domains have been prepared so that there is no overlay between them, in particular: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean have their limit at the longitude of the Strait of Gibraltar;
\item The Sea of Marmara is assigned to the Mediterranean Sea region;
\item The North Sea and the NE Atlantic Ocean are separated by an imaginary line at 48°N, corresponding approximately to the latitude of Brittany (western France);
\item The Baltic Sea and the North Sea have their limit located 
\end{itemize}
We can see the almost straight lines corresponding to oceanographic campaigns and also the availability of coastal data, with the exception of the northern coast of Africa. 

\subsection{File preparation}

The original files are provided in the form of ODV \citep[Ocean Data View,][]{SCHLITZER2002} collections. There are then converted to ODV netCDF, keeping the relevant metadata (i.e. those relative to the originators) in the exported files. Finally, the files are converted to ragged array netCDF using a script in Julia. The goal is to decrease the time needed to read the observations from the different regions: in the ODV netCDF files, the observations are organised by profile, and reading all of them means we have to loop over each profile. Meanwhile, for the creation of the gridded products, the information about the profile is not needed anymore and the data can be stored as vectors.

EDMO code and CDI \citep{Schaap2010}

With this format change, the files can be read in less than one minute (versus several hours for the ODV collections or ODV netCDF).

These operations were performed with ODV version 5.7.2 \citep{Schlitzer2024}.
 

\subsection{Spatial distribution}

The hexbin plot (Fig. ) provides another view on the data density. The regions with the highest coverage are located in the Baltic Sea and in the southern part of the North Sean while in general lower data densities are found at the edges of the global domain. The Mediterranean sea also exhibits an inhomogeneous data coverage. 

The panels of Fig. x also highlights the differences between the variables: for phosphate, silicate and oxygen, most of the domain is covered, whereas for ammonium, dissolved organic nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, chlorophyll, large subdomains are almost void of measurements. This will impact the quality of the interpolated field (Section …), which depends on the quality of the measurements and their availability.











\subsection{Temporal distribution}
TEXT

\subsection{Value distributions}

The value distribution (Fig. ) shows different patterns according to the variable considered. The dissolved oxygen concentration is the closest to a Gaussian. Ammonium, chlorophyll-a, nitrogen and silicate distributions are all characterised by a dominant number of measurements for small concentrations (close to zero) and few observations of high concentration. The case of phosphate seems to be a superposition of the two previous cases, where the lar







\subsection{File format}
The original data collections are provided as ODV \citep[Ocean Data View,][]{SCHLITZER2002} data collections. Such collections are easily read then exported to another format using the ODV software tool. In the present work we exported the collections to netCDF files, which are in turn are used as input files for the preparation of the climatologies (next Section). 
Along with the data (coordinates, time, depth and observed values), a set of metadata is assigned to each measurement. The complete list of metadata items is provided in the Appendix. Among them we find information about the instrument, the cruise and the institute that performed the measurements. 

\section{The interpolation method}

In this paper, we refer to \textit{gridding} as the process of computing the values of a variable (for instance: sea water temperature) on the nodes of a regular grid, based on observations of that variable at different locations and times.
The creation of gridded fields using sparse, in situ observations can be performed using different techniques. For the sake of simplicity, we will not review all of them but will insist on the distintion between two groups of tecniques:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The interpolation techniques: the field has to contain (or pass through) all the data points. For two-dimensional cases, an example of such a method is the bi-linear interpolation. Due to the different types of noise affecting the measurements in the ocean (instrumental, representativity, \ldots), such techniques are not the most suitable.
\item The approximation 
\end{enumerate}

The climatologies, consisting of a set of gridded fields for different depths and time periods, are produced by applying the Data Interpolating Variational Analysis in n dimensions (DIVAnd, see next Section) to the datasets presented in Section~\ref{sec:insitu}. Such gridded fields are frequently used in oceanography, for different purposes ranging from data visualisation to model initialisation or validation of measurements.  
While temperature and salinity (T and S) climatologies have been produced for various regions of the World Ocean using different interpolation techniques, climatologies for eutrophication-related variables are less frequent. The World Ocean Atlas (WOA) makes climatologies available for oxygen \citep[Dissolved Oxygen, Apparent Oxygen Utilization, and Oxygen Saturation][]{Garcia2024} and for dissolved inorganic nutrients \citep[phosphate, nitrate and nitrate+nitrite, silicate][]{Garcia2024b} at a resolution of 1° by 1° for the global ocean. The availability of measurements from the EMODnet Chemistry data collections makes it  possible to increase the spatial resolution in certain domains, hence the interest of the regional products presented in this paper.

\subsection{Method}

DIVAnd is an analysis method designed to generate fields on a curvilinear grid grid from a set of in situ measurements \citep{BARTH2014}. It is a new version of the DIVA tool \citep{TROUPIN2012,BECKERS2014} that was previously limited to 2 dimensions (usually longitude and latitude). With DIVAnd, it is now possible to perform the analysis on an arbitrary number of dimensions, typically the horizontal dimension (longitudes and latitudes), the vertical dimension (depth or pressure) and the time. With the previous version of  the DIVA tool, climatologies were obtained by stacking 2-dimensional layers computed for different depths and time periods. 
One of the main advantages of the method over widely used methods such as the Optimal Interpolation \citep[OI,][]{GANDIN1966,BRETHERTON1976} is that DIVAnd (and DIVA) naturally takes into account physical obstacles, typically the presence of land separating two bodies of water.  

DIVAnd is written in Julia \citep{Bezanson2017}, a fast, dynamically-type programming language, designed to ensure high-performance computation. While the previous code was written in Fortran, Julia ensures that high-resolution analysis using several millions of data points could be run in reasonable times, i.e. maximum a few days for the largest domain. This is necessary as usually to create a regional climatology, it is necessary to repeat the analysis several times in order to adapt the parameters and possibly remove suspect observations.

\subsection{Implementation}

\citep{TROUPIN2025}
A set of Jupyter-notebooks \citep[https://jupyter.org][]{KLUYVER2016} is
provided as guidelines explaining all the steps related to the creation of a climatology:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Data reading;
\item Creation of the land-sea mask based on the bathymetry;
\item Parameter optimisation;
\item Analysis;
\item Creation of figures.
\end{enumerate}

The GEBCO bathymetry (GEBCO 2021) was used with a resolution reduced by a factor 4 with respect to the original, was used for the creation of the land-sea mask
needed by DIVAnd (Fig.~\ref{fig:gebco_bathy_mask_domains3}).

\subsection{Products}

Three types of climatologies were produced:
1. All European Seas – monthly maps on a domain covering all the regional seas
2. Sea region – at seasonal scale and for periods of 6 years, using a moving 6-year window
seasonal maps
3. Coastal area maps - at seasonal scale

EMODnet Chemistry Regional climatologies have been produced at seasonal scale and for periods of 6 years,
using a moving 6-year window. The season definitions used are defined specifically for each basin. 6-year
periods span from 1980-1985 until 2013-2018 (but highly depending on data availability for each sea/each
parameter/each season). 

\subsection{Product descriptions}

\subsubsection{File format}

The output of the analysis is a set of netCDF files storing the gridded fields generated by the analysis are written in netCDF \citep{Rew1990,Brown1993}, making use of the NCDatasets.jl library \citep{Barth2024}.

\subsubsection{Gridded variables}

MODnet Chemistry climatologies are provided as masked fields using relative error threshold 0.3 and
0.5, i.e., the gridded field is not shown at locations where the relative error is above 0.3 (or 0.5). Doing
so, areas where no data are available (thus extrapolation has to be performed) are not displayed. DIVAnd
settings are specific for each type of climatology/sea region and are detailed in the following chapters

Figure 1.1 - EMODnet Chemistry Regional climatologies.
For each Regional climatology, at least, the following WMS layers are available (Fig. 1.2):

threshold 0.5
❖ Interpolated observations: station positions used to build the Water body gridded map
Additional fields:
❖ Water body gridded map
❖ Error standard deviation of the gridded map
❖ Water body gridded map masked using relative error threshold 0.3
❖ Relative error of gridded map
❖ Logarithm10 of number of data in bins
❖ Logarithm10 of number of outliers data in bins
❖ Deepest value of water body gridded map
❖ Deepest value of water body gridded map masked using relative error threshold 0.3
❖ Deepest value of water body gridded map masked using relative error threshold 0.5


\subsubsection{A posteriori quality control}

The initial data collections, presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:insitu}, underwent rigorous quality checks that ensure the final quality of the datasets. When performing analysis, it is also possible to detect suspicious data based on the residuals. The residual of a given data point is computed as the difference between the observed value and the analysed field at the location of the data point. In general, forcing the residuals to be small, i.e., to have an analysed field closed to the observations, does not guarantee good results: the field obtained will be noisy an not representative of a long-term mean state. Still, in an analysis performed with realistic parameters (here: correlation length and noise-to-signal ratio), large residuals might be the signal of either suspect data, or data not compatible with the climatology (HERE, NEED TO BETTER EXPLAIN).

The residuals for the pan-European gridded fields were provided to each regional leader. They were then asked to flag out suspect data, basing their decision on the values of the residuals. Finally, a new analysis was performed on a dataset in which the suspect observations were discarded. The locations of those discarded observations is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals}.
