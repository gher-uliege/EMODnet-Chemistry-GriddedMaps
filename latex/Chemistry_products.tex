\begin{abstract}

An ocean climatology is made up of gridded fields representing the long-term average state of a given variable for different time periods and at different depth levels. They are used for model initialiation, data visualisation, and also for informing about the mean state of the ocean over the period of interest. They can be global (i.e., covering the World Ocean) or regional. Most of the climatologies deal with temperature and salinity, while chemical and biological variables are less frequently addressed, often because of the sparser data coverage.

We present a set of high-resolution, regional climatologies for six eutrophication variables covering different sub-domains of the European seas. The variables consist of ammonium, chlorophyll-a, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, phosphate and silicate concentrations. The climatologies are generated with the Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis in n dimensions (DIVAnd), a software tools that implements a multi-dimensional interpolation based on a variational method. The in situ observations used as input to DIVAnd are prepared and quality controlled by regional experts, following a standardised procedure. 

The different climatologies have different spatial extents: a large domain covering all the Europeans seas, 6~regional domains (Arctic Ocean, North-east Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and North Sea) and 4~coastal zones (Loire River, Gulf of Riga, Po River and Danube Delta). The spatial resolution and the analysis parameters required by DIVAnd are adapted according to the specificities of each domain. The climatologies can be visualised through the EMODnet Central Portal viewer and are made available free of charge as netCDF files following the Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions.

\introduction 

EMODnet (European Marine Observation and Data Network) is the in situ, marine data service of the European Commission Directorate - General Maritime Affairs and Fisheries \citep{MartinMiguez2019}. Initiated in 2009 as a pilot project, EMODnet adhere to the following principles \citep{Shepherd2018}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The focus is on marine data; satellite data or fisheries survey are not considered. 
\item Multi-purpose data products, based on the raw data, are created and distributed. 
\item The data origin and ownership are preserved, both in the raw data and in the products. 
\item The observations are divided into 7~thematic lots: bathymetry, biology, chemistry, geology, human activities, physics and seabed habitats. 
\end{enumerate} 

The EMODnet portal (\url{https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu}) delivers marine data and products, along with their associated metadata in a uniform and seamless way, by relying on common standards, procedures and vocabularies, and also following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) principles \citep {Wilkinson2016,Wilkinson2019}. With the continuously improving data access, a wider range of users is reached, potentially leading to sustainable economic development, often referred to as the Blue Growth \citep{Commission2012}. 

One of the underlying principle of EMODnet can be summarised by the motto "\textit{Collect once, use many times}". Indeed, it is frequent that marine data are collected with an initial, single purpose, for instance the study of an oceanographic process or the monitoring of a given area. However, if these observations made their way to centralised data portals, they can be re-used and combined with other measurements or other parameters, thus triggering the creation of new, added-value products that were not considered originally. Examples of such added-value products include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The aggregated datasets: they consist of large ensembles of measurements obtained from various data providers; the measurements generally undergo a suite of checks to assess their quality: a flag, representing the quality of the observation, is assigned to it. Thereby, users have the choice to select data according to their final purpose, for instance keeping only the observations that were set as good.
\item The climatologies, sometimes referred to as (hydrographic) atlas \citep[e.g.][]{soton16209,Iona_2018}: they consist of a collection of gridded fields containing the averaged values of the variable of interest, at different depth levels and for different time periods, obtained by interpolating the in situ observations onto a regular grid.
\end{enumerate}

Both types of products are accompanied with metadata, which indicate how, when and by whom, the data were collected, according to the ISO-19115 and 19139 specifications. For the climatologies, metadata also have to include information about all the individual data providers who contributed to the final products. These pieces of information can be visualised in the EMODnet Data Product Catalog (\url{https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/geonetwork}).

The manuscript is organised according to the following structure: Section~\ref{sec:insitu}: description of the in situ observations; Section~\ref{sec:method}: description of the griddng technique (DIVAnd); Section~\ref{sec:clim}: presentation and validation of the the final products (climatologies). 


\section{In situ datasets\label{sec:insitu}}
%-------------------------------------------

The main goal of Chemistry thematic lot of EMODnet is the collection, harmonization and quality control of data gathered from national monitoring efforts and from research activities, thus providing relevant information for the assessment of the \textit{Good Environmental Status} \citep[GES,][]{Vinci2017}. The underlying network is constituted by more than 45 National Oceanographic Data Centres (NODCs) from 27 countries. The data collection is centred on three main topics: marine litter \citep{Vinci2018}, marine contaminants (e.g., hydrocarbons, pesticides, heavy metals, antifoulants) and eutrophication \citep{Giorgetti2020}, which is the focus of the present work. 

Throughout the project lifetime, considerable efforts have been undertaken in terms of harmonization, standardization and validation of the data and metadata. In practice, the data management is governed by the SeaDataNet standards and formats \citep{Schaap2010}, the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE) rules and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) protocols. 

The aggregated datasets, described in this section and used for the creation of the gridded products (Section~\ref{sec:products}), contain several variables related to eutrophication and acidity of the ocean. They are separated by geographical regions (as described in Section~\ref{sec:domains}).

All the data collections have in common the strong heterogeneity, which will be illustrated in the next sections: 
\begin{itemize}
\item spatially: while some regions are density covered by observations, other regions have been barely sampled (or the existing observations have not made their ways to the NODCs);
\item temporally: the improvements in ocean observing systems helped increased the quantity of collected observations in the last decades;
\item by variables: some variables, for instance oxygen concentration, are collected more frequently than the others.
\end{itemize}
This multiple heterogeneity has to considered in the gridded fields: the interpolation method is expected to provide an estimation of the error on the analysis, based on the availability of observations. 


\subsection{Variables\label{sec:variables}}

Eutrophication variables are those related to nutrients and their accumulation in the water column. The 6~chemicals selected for this work, listed in Table~\ref{tab:variables}, are relevant for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive \citep[MSFD,][]{EURO2008}, in particular the Descriptors no.~5, and the assessment of Good Environmental Status (GES). 

The parameter names are based on the P01 Parameter Usage Vocabulary (\url{https://vocab.seadatanet.org/p01-facet-search}), which ensures consistency and interoperability \citep{iocmanualsguides54}. 

Two main types of data are considered: the profiles, for which the primary variable is the depth; the time series, for which the primary variable is the time (while the depth is generally fixed. They are initially separated but then used together for the production of the climatologies. 

\begin{table}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Domains\label{sec:domains}}

The main region of interest encompasses the European Seas (Tab.~\ref{tab:regions} and Fig.~\ref{fig:gebco_bathy_mask_domains3}). The regional domains have been delimited in order to avoid overlay between them:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean have their limit at the longitude of the Strait of Gibraltar.
\item The Sea of Marmara is assigned to the Mediterranean Sea region.
\item The North Sea and the Northeast Atlantic Ocean are separated by an imaginary line at 48°N, corresponding approximately to the latitude of Brittany (western France);
\item The Baltic Sea and the North Sea have their limit located in the Kattegat (between Denmark and Sweden).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure*}[t]
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{gebco_bathy_mask_domains3}
\caption{Regional domains (colored lines) for the gridded products overlaid on the GEBCO bathymetry and the surface land-sea mask, used to delimit the region where the interpolation is performed.\label{fig:gebco_bathy_mask_domains3}}
\end{figure*}

Along with the regional seas, 4~coastal regions have been defined. They are used for the creation of specific products near river mouths (see Sect.~\ref{sec:clim}) with a finer spatial resolution. Therefore, there is a total of 11~spatial regions where climatologies are created.

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Metadata}

Each observation comes with a \textit{Common Data Index} \citep[CDI,][]{Schaap2021,Schaap2022}, which provides details about the availability and geographical spreading of marine data sets managed by the SeaDataNet data centres. The index is based upon ISO 19115 and ISO 19139 standards, which define metadata for the description of geographic information, and supported by SeaDataNet Common Vocabularies (\url{https://vocab.seadatanet.org/search}). 

By using the CDI records, it is possible to keep track of the information regarding the data originators (\url{https://cdi.seadatanet.org/search}), ensuring that their effort is correctly acknowledged in the final product metadata. The CDI has been published in the Ocean Data Standards, managed by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the UNESCO \citet{Schaap2021}.

Another relevant metadata field is the European Directory of Marine Organisations (EDMO) code, which indicates up-to-date addresses and activity profiles of the institution (research centers, universities, data center, \ldots) involved in the data holding.

\subsection{Quality assessment\label{sec:dataqualitycontrol}}

One of the main added value of the aggregated datasets is the validation procedure applied to assess the quality of the measurements \citep{Barth2015,Lipizer2021,Lipizer2023}. The EMODnet Chemistry quality control chain involves the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Metadata completeness: it ensures that temporal and spatial information (longitude, latitude, sampling depth, station bottom depth, time) is present.
\item Harmonization of units and parameter names: it ensures that a given variable is always expressed with the same units and has always the same name (Tab.~\ref{tab:variables}). 
\item Quality flagging of data and metadata: a quality flag is assigned to the measurements and to their corresponding metadata.
\end{enumerate} 
<<<<<<< HEAD
The last step is described in details in \citet{Lipizer2023}, where the quality flag setting is explained. A particular attention is paid to the range check: each regional sea is decomposed into sub-domains and the range of acceptable values, for each variable, is set in those sub-domains. For instance, the acceptable chlorophyll concentration values in the Northern Adriatic Sea (strongly influenced by river discharge) are between 0 and 20~$mg/m{^3}$, while this range is narrower in other sub-regions.

\subsection{Spatial distribution}

As stated in Sect.~\ref{sec:insitu}, the datasets are characterised by their strong heterogeneity. Figure~\ref{fig:phosphatedata} illustrates this features by displaying the phosphate and the ammonium data points, in the 6~regional domains from Tab.~\ref{tab:regions}. The differences between the spatial distributions of the two variables is obvious, with the ammonium mostly sampled in coastal areas, whereas the phosphate observations have a more extended spatial coverage.

\begin{figure*}[t]
\includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{observations_Water_body_phosphate.png}\includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{observations_Water_body_ammonium.png}
\caption{Locations of the phosphate concentration and the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration profiles.\label{fig:phosphatedata}}
\end{figure*}

The hexagonal binning (hexbin) plot (Fig.~\ref{fig:phosphatedatahexbin}) displays the number of observations within hexagonal cells. The regions with the highest coverage are located in the Baltic Sea and in the southern part of the North Sea, while in general lower data densities are found at the edges of the global domain. The Mediterranean sea also exhibits an inhomogeneous data coverage; with zones with almost no measurements at all (coastal zones of Tunisia and Lybia). The data coverage will obviously impact the quality of the gridded fields (Section~\ref{sec:climS}).

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{observations_Water_body_phosphate_hex.png}
\caption{Hexbin plot corresponding to the phosphate concentration profiles.\label{fig:phosphatedatahexbin}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Temporal distribution}

The number of phosphate concentration observations per year and per months are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phosphatetime}. The first subplot exhibits an overall positive trend from 1960 oto 1990 approximately, followed by a more stationnary period. The last years have less observations, due to the typical time lag between the data collection and their inclusion into the international databases. Another striking feature visible in the histogram is the contributions by the different regions. For instance, the phosphate concentration in the North Sea only appear in the mid 1990's. The Baltic sea stands out as the largest contributor for this variable, despite its reduced geographical extension.

The second subplot shows the seasonal, with a factor 2 between the number of available of observations in the most sampled month (May) and in the least sample month (December). 

The histograms for the other variables are not included in the paper, but they also display similar heterogeneities in the temporal distribution, along with variations related to the variables themselves. 

\begin{figure*}[t]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{stacked_histogram_Water_body_phosphate.png}
\caption{Locations of the phosphate concentration profiles.\label{fig:phosphatetime}}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Value distributions}

The value distribution (Fig. ) shows different patterns according to the variable considered. The dissolved oxygen concentration is the closest to a Gaussian. Ammonium, chlorophyll-a, nitrogen and silicate distributions are all characterised by a dominant number of measurements for small concentrations (close to zero) and few observations of high concentration. The case of phosphate seems to be a superposition of the two previous cases, where the lar


\subsection{File format}

The original data collections are provided as ODV (Ocean Data View) data collections, which is one of the standard format promoted by SeaDataNet marine data
infrastructure \citep{Lowry2023}. Such collections are easily read then exported to another format using the ODV software tool \citep{SCHLITZER2002}. In the present work we exported the collections to netCDF files, which are in turn are used as input files for the preparation of the climatologies (next Section). 
Along with the data (coordinates, time, depth and observed values), a set of metadata is assigned to each measurement. The complete list of metadata items is provided in the Appendix. Among them we find information about the instrument, the cruise and the institute that performed the measurements. 

\section{The gridding method\label{sec:method}}
%---------------------------------

In this paper, we refer to \textit{gridding} as the process of computing the values of a variable (for instance: sea water temperature) on the nodes of a regular grid, based on observations of that variable at different locations and times. The creation of gridded fields using sparse, in situ observations can be performed using different techniques. For the sake of simplicity, we will not review all of them but will insist on the distinction between two groups of techniques:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The interpolation techniques: the field has to contain (or pass through) all the data points. For two-dimensional cases, an example of such a method is the bi-linear interpolation. Due to the different types of noise affecting the measurements in the ocean (instrumental, representativeness, \ldots), such techniques are not the most suitable.
\item The approximation 
\end{enumerate}

The climatologies, consisting of a set of gridded fields for different depths and time periods, are produced by applying the Data Interpolating Variational Analysis in n dimensions (DIVAnd, see next Section) to the datasets presented in Section~\ref{sec:insitu}. Such gridded fields are frequently used in oceanography, for different purposes ranging from data visualisation to model initialisation or validation of measurements.  

Temperature and salinity (T and S) climatologies have been produced for various regions of the World Ocean using different interpolation techniques, yet climatologies for eutrophication-related variables are less frequent. The World Ocean Atlas (WOA) makes climatologies available for oxygen \citep[Dissolved Oxygen, Apparent Oxygen Utilization, and Oxygen Saturation,][]{Garcia2024} and for dissolved inorganic nutrients \citep[phosphate, nitrate and nitrate + nitrite, silicate,][]{Garcia2024b} at a resolution of 1°by 1° for the global ocean. The availability of measurements from the EMODnet Chemistry data collections makes it possible to increase the spatial resolution in certain domains, hence the interest of the regional products presented in this paper.


\subsection{DIVAnd}

The Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis in n dimensions method \citep[DIVAnd][]{BARTH2014} is designed to grid arbitrarily located observations in two or more dimensions, onto a curvilinear grid. Typically the dimensions are the longitude, the latitude, the depth and the time of the observations. DIVAnd in an evolution of the DIVA tool \citep{TROUPIN2012,BECKERS2014}, which was limited to 2-dimensional interpolations (hence climatologies were build by stacking 2D layers at different depths and for different periods). 

Mathematically, the DIVAnd technique is based on the minimisation of a cost function, in which the deviation from the observations, the deviation from a first guess (also called background or reference field) and abruptly varying fields are taken into account. The main strengths of the method with respect to widely used methods such as the Optimal Interpolation \citep[OI,][]{GANDIN1966,BRETHERTON1976} are its capacity to deal with very large datasets, as the numerical cost is almost independent from the number of observations, and the natural decoupling of regions based the topography. In other words, a basin separated from another by land is not affected by the observations located in the other basin.

The source code is written in Julia \citep{Bezanson2017}, a fast, dynamically-type programming language, designed to ensure high-performance computation. Julia ensures that high-resolution analysis using several millions of data points could be run in reasonable times, i.e. maximum a few days for the largest domain. This is necessary as usually to create a regional climatology, it is necessary to repeat the analysis several times in order to adapt the parameters and possibly remove suspect observations.

DIVAnd has already been applied successfuly applied on a wide range of ocean variables such as temperature, salinity \citep{COATANOAN2021}, sea surface height \citep{DOGLIONI2023}, velocity \citep{TROUPIN2022}, dissolved inorganic nutrients \citep{BELGACEM2021} or oxygen concentration \citep{CLIMATO2023}. In this work, the version v2.7.12 of the code \citep{BARTH2024DIVAnd} is used.

\subsection{Implementation}

For the creation of the gridded maps, regional leaders are provided with a set of Jupyter notebooks \citep[https://jupyter.org][]{KLUYVER2016}, which serve as guidelines explaining all the steps to perform for the creation of a climatology:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Data reading and file format conversion;
\item Creation of the land-sea mask based on the bathymetry;
\item Parameter optimisation;
\item Analysis;
\item Creation of figures;
\item Creation of metadata for the inclusion in catalogue.
\end{enumerate}
The relevant notebooks (those dealing with the analysis) are then modified according to the specificities of each domain. They have been submitted for publication \citep{TROUPIN2025}.

The GEBCO bathymetry (GEBCO 2021) was used with a resolution reduced by a factor 4 with respect to the original, was used for the creation of the land-sea mask
needed by DIVAnd (Fig.~\ref{fig:gebco_bathy_mask_domains3}).


%----------------------------------------------
\section{Gridded climatologies\label{sec:clim}}
%----------------------------------------------

For the sake of conciseness, the present section will focus on the "All European Seas" products. The procedure applied for the creation of the other climatologies is similar, and details can be found in the technical report by \citep{BUGA2021}. The URLs of the netCDF files storing the climatologies are provided at the end of the paper.


\subsection{File preparation}

The original files are provided in the form of ODV \citep[Ocean Data View,][]{SCHLITZER2002} collections. There are then converted to ODV netCDF, keeping the relevant metadata (i.e. those relative to the originators) in the exported files. Finally, the files are converted to ragged array netCDF using a script in Julia. The goal is to decrease the time needed to read the observations from the different regions: in the ODV netCDF files, the observations are organised by profile, and reading all of them means we have to loop over each profile. Meanwhile, for the creation of the gridded products, the information about the profile is not needed anymore and the data can be stored as vectors.

EDMO code and CDI \citep{Schaap2010}

With this format change, the files can be read in less than one minute (versus several hours for the ODV collections or ODV netCDF).

These operations were performed with ODV version 5.7.2 \citep{Schlitzer2024}.

\subsection{Product types\label{sec:products}}

Three sets of climatologies were produced, grouped according to their spatial extent (see Tab.~\ref{tab:regions}): 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textit{All European Seas} products: they consist of monthly fields (considering all the available years), computed over a spatial domain covering all the regional seas
\item The \textit{Sea region} products: the are computed on a seasonal scale and for periods of 6 years, using a moving 6-year window. The definition of the seasons and the 6-year time periods are not the same for all the regions. 
\item The \textit{Coastal Area} products: they are computed over small areas near river mouth, and at seasonal scale.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{File format}

The output of the analysis is a set of netCDF files storing the gridded fields generated by the analysis are written in netCDF \citep{Rew1990,Brown1993,Rew2006}, making use of the NCDatasets.jl Julia library \citep{Barth2024}. The file sizes depend on the type of product (as defined in Section~\ref{sec:products}) and the region of interest. The largest files are for the Northeast Atlantic

\subsection{Gridded variables}

The main variable stores the 4-dimension gridded field for each of the 6 selected variables. In addition, a relative error field informs about the confidence one can have in the results. It typically exhibits larger values in regions with where no observations were collected, while the value are the lowest where the coverage is most dense. The error field is used to mask out the gridded field in regions where the error is considered to be too high. In practice, gridded fields masked using relative error threshold of 30\% and 50\% are calculated. The field masked with the 30\% error threshold is displayed as the principal layer in the Web Map Service (WMS). The motivation is to prevent users from interpreting the results where no data are available. 


\begin{figure*}[t]
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Water_body_phosphate_depth-100_month-10_additional_fields.png}
\caption{Additional fields computed along with the main analysis.\label{fig:additionalfields}}
\end{figure*}

Other variables containing the deepest values, masked with the same relative error thresholds, are also computed. 

\subsection{Validation}

The quality and the validation of the final products rely on the assessment of the different steps of the processing:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The quality control of the aggregated datasets used as the input to the DIVAnd tool (Section~\ref{sec:dataqualitycontrol});
\item The overall capability of DIVAnd to generate interpolated fields consistent with the observations;
\item The absence of unrealistic features in the gridded product.
\end{enumerate}

An additional step frequently performed for the validation consists in comparing the results with an existing climatology. For our products, the most obvious candidate is the World Ocean Atlas, which provides climatologies for the oxygen concentration \citep{Garcia2024} and for dissolved inorganic nutrients \citep{Garcia2024b}. Since the EMODnet climatologies consist of regional gridded fields, they have the advantage to offer finer spatial resolutions than global products. Another advantage of the EMODnet products is the relative error field (see for instance Fig.~\ref{fig:additionalfields}) computed by DIVAnd. The WOA also provides the standard error of analysis, based on the differences between the objectively analyzed and statistical mean fields \citep{Levitus2012}, but this variable is not available for the eutrophication climatologies.

\subsubsection{A posteriori quality control\label{sec:posterioriQC}}

The initial data collections, presented in Section~\ref{sec:insitu}, underwent rigorous quality checks that ensure the final quality of the datasets. When performing analysis, it is also possible to detect suspicious data based on the residuals. The residual of a given data point is computed as the difference between the observed value and the analysed field at the location of the data point. In general, forcing the residuals to be small, i.e., to have an analysed field closed to the observations, does not guarantee good results: the field obtained will be noisy an not representative of a long-term mean state. Still, in an analysis performed with realistic parameters (here: correlation length and noise-to-signal ratio), large residuals might be the signal of either suspect data, or data not compatible with the climatology (HERE, NEED TO BETTER EXPLAIN).

The residuals for the pan-European gridded fields were provided to each regional leader. They were then asked to flag out suspect data, basing their decision on the values of the residuals. Finally, a new analysis was performed on a dataset in which the suspect observations were discarded. The locations of those discarded observations is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals}. 

\subsection{Result exploitation}

The climatologies can be exploited in various ways and by a wide range of users. The following descriptions is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to offer a few relevant applications.

\subsubsection{Visualisation}

Climatologies can be used to display ocean properties, for instance in a teaching context. While sea water temperature maps have made their way to mainstream media, thanks to marine heat waves, maps showing concentrations of oxygen or nutrients are rarely presented. Considering the example of Fig.~\ref{fig:additionalfields}, one can directly see the higher abundance of phosphate north of 60°N, the lower concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea contrasting with the larger values in the Black Sea.

\subsubsection{Quality control of new observations}

They are several criteria to detect uncorrect data, or to be more accurate, to assign a quality flag to measurements \citep{CUMMINGS2011,CABANES2021}. The most natural test consists of checking if the observed value falls inside a given range. For a given variable, such range can be global, i.e. the same for any region, any depth or any time period. A possible refinement of the criterion relies on a climatology: the comparison is performed with respect to the "normal" values (defined by the World Meteorological Organization as the 30-year average of data). If the difference between the newly acquired observation and the corresponding climatologies is larger than a select threshold (based on the standard deviation for example), then that observations can be considered as suspect.

This application was performed in this work, as described in Section~\ref{sec:posterioriQC}.

\subsubsection{Assessment of marine ecosystems}

Combining information about the nutrient and the oxygen in a given region allows one to evaluate the ecosystem health and examine its role in terms of primary production or carbon sequestration.

Concretely, since 2009, EMODnet Chemistry has interacted with the stakeholders involved in the Regional Seas Conventions (OSPAR, HELCOM, \ldots) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). A Board of experts on the MSFD, formed in 2017, aims to advise the consortium on the products and services: parameters, spatial and temporal resolutions of the data products. Doing so, it is expected that the data collections and the climatologies will contribute to the MSFD Descriptors D5 (eutrophication), among others.
